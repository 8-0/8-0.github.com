Matz did a really good job teaching us some Japanese while giving insights on interesting stuff that the Ruby Core team is planning to add to Ruby. He also said that despite the fact that everyone knows that we need better concurrency and parallelism  solutions, it is yet unclear what kind of approach Ruby Core team will take.

SATOSHI TAGOMORI's talk was one of the most prectical ones. The story of Threasure data the company behind `fluend` is interesting as it's not only ruby for software wheight lifting ie bigdata but also using and building OSS as company foundation.
