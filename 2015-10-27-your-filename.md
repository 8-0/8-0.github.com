Matz did a really good job teaching us some Japanese while giving insights on interesting stuff that the Ruby Core team is planning to add to Ruby. He also said that despite the fact that everyone knows that we need better concurrency and parallelism  solutions, it is yet unclear what kind of approach Ruby Core team will take.
